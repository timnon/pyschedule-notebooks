    "- **mip.solve(scenario,kind) :** time-indexed MIP-formulation build on top of package [pulp](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp). Use parameter \"kind\" to select the MIP-solver (\"CBC\" (default if kind is not provided), \"CPLEX\", \"GLPK\"). CBC is part of pulp and hence works out of the box.\n",
    "- **mip.solve_bigm(scenario,kind) :** classical bigM-type MIP-formulation, works for small models.\n",
    "- **ortools.solve(scenario) :** the open source CP-solver of Google, a little restricted but good to ensure feasibility of larger models. Make sure that package [ortools](https://github.com/google/or-tools) is installed.\n",
    "- **cpoptimizer.solve(scenario) :** [IBM CP Optimizer](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/commerce/optimization/cplex-cp-optimizer/), requires command \"oplrun\" to be executable. Industrial-scale solver that runs fast on very large problems.\n",
    "- **cpoptimizer.solve_docloud(scenario,api_key) :** IBM CP Optimizer hosted in the cloud, you need to provide an \"api_key\" which you can get [here](https://developer.ibm.com/docloud/) for a trial.\n",

    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Test Cases\n",
    "basic test cases that are not really constraints but still represent different capabilities:\n",
    "- **ZERO :** tasks of length zero are allwed, e.g. `T1 = S.Task(length=0)`.\n",
    "- **NONUNIT :** tasks of lenght > 1 are allowed, e.g. `T1 = S.Task(length=3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precedences\n",
    "- **BOUND :** normal bounds, e.g. `T1 > 3` or `T1 < 5`, T1 starts after time step 3 or ends before time step 5, respectively.\n",
    "- **BOUNDTIGHT :** tight bounds, e.g. `T1 >= 3` or `T1 <= 5`, T1 starts at time step 3 or ends at time step 5, respectively.\n",
    "- **LAX :** lax precedences, e.g. `T1 < T2`, T1 is finished before T2 starts.\n",
    "- **LAXPLUS :** lax precedences with offset, e.g. `T1 + 3 < T2`, T1 is finished 3 time units before T2 starts. This can be also written as `T2 - T1 > 3`. Note that `T2 - T1 < 3` will ensure that the T2 start at most 3 time units after T1 ends.\n",
    "- **TIGHT :** tight precedences, e.g. `T1 <= T2`, T2 starts exactly when T1 finishes.\n",
    "- **TIGHTPLUS :** tight precedences with offset, e.g. `T1 + 3 <= T2`, T2 starts exactly 3 time units after T1 finishes. This can be also written as `T2 - T1 >= 3`. Note that `T2 - T1 <= 3` will ensure that the T2 start exactly 3 time units after T1 ends.\n",
    "- **COND :** conditional precedences, e.g. `T1 + 3 << T2`, if T1 and T2 share any resource and T1 finishes before T2, then T1 is finished even 3 time units before T2 starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources\n",
    "each task needs at least one resource. To keep the syntax concise, pyschedule used % as an operator to connect tasks and resources\n",
    "- **MULT :** multiple resources, e.g. `T1 += [R1,R2]`, T1 uses R1 and R2.\n",
    "- **ALT :** alternative resources, e.g. `T1 += R1|R2`, T1 uses either R1 or R2. For a list of resources L it is also possible to write `T1 += pyschedule.alt(L)` or `T1 += pyschedule.alt( R for R in L )`.\n",
    "- **ALTMULT :** alternative resources which are similar for different tasks, e.g. `A = R1|R2; T1 += A; T2 += A`, T1 and T2 either use R1 or R2, but they both use the same one.\n",
    "- **CUMUL :** cumulative resources, e.g. `R1 = S.Resource('R1',size=3); T1 += R1*2`, R1 has size 3 and T1 uses 2 units of that size whenever run. This can be used to model worker pools or any other resource with a high multiplicity. Using a resource of size n instead n resources of size 1 often helps the solver.\n",
    "- **CAP :** capacities, e.g. `R1['length'] <= 4`, the sum of the lengths of the tasks assigned to R1 must be at most 4. We can also generate other parameters, e.g. first set `T1.work = 3` and then `R1['work'] <= 4`.\n",
    "- **CAPSLICE :** capacities, e.g. `R1['length'][:10] <= 4`, the sum of the lengths of the tasks assigned to R1 during periods 1 to 9 must be at most 4.\n",
    "- **CAPDIFF :** change in capacity over time like a derivate, e.g. `R1['length'].diff <= 4`, the number of times resource R switches from running to not running or vice versa is at most 4. We can also use other parameters than length, e.g. first set `T1.work = 3` and then `R1['work'].diff <= 4`.\n",
    "- **CAPDIFFSLICE :** change of capacity over time in slice, e.g. `R1['length'][:10].diff <= 4`, the number of times resource R switches from running to not running or vice versa in periods 0 to 9 is at most 4\n"
